# Ecommerce Website - HoneyPot-Furniture

This was a coding test, which had me create a fully reponsive ecommerce website from a UX/UI design. This website which uses HTML, SASS, JavaScript & Responsive Design.

## Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design that was given to me into small chunks, via divide and conquer.
The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that was given to me. 
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design
* Adding favicon to a page 

## Challenges 

* My hardest challenge was the product section, as this required me to do a lot of 
research into 'clip path' and implementing shapes into HTML sections, via CSS.
* I ran into an issue with the font url which allowed me to use the 'feeling-pasionate' font. The issue was that the font won't appear on devices that weren't my own.
To solve this I simply had to add 'https' and not 'http', as most browsers will block the 'http'.
