# Ecommerce Website - HoneyPot-Furniture

This was a coding test, which had me create a fully reponsive ecommerce website from a UX/UI design. This website which uses HTML, SASS, JavaScript & Responsive Design.

## Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design that was given to me into small chunks, via divide and conquer.
I had to learn how to:
* create website sections as close as possible to the design that was given to me. My hardest challenge was the product section, as this required me to do a lot of 
research into 'clip path' and implementing shapes into HTML sections, via CSS.

* Responsive Design
